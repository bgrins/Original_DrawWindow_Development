    <p style='text-align:right;border-top:solid 10px; margin-left:5px; padding-top:6px; margin-top:3px; '>One aspect of designing for the web that almost immediately offends designers is
    the lack of fonts that are considered safe to use. While it is true that there are
    only a handful of web safe fonts, the ones we do have at our disposal can be quite
    powerful and diversely useful. On top of that, CSS gives us a nice little thing
    called a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/CSS/pr_font_font-family.asp">font
    stack</a>.</p>

    <h4>Font stacks give you freedom.</h4>

    <p>You want to use Gill Sans? Go right ahead. Nothing should stop you. Font stacks
    are prioritized lists of fonts, defined in the CSS font-family attribute, that the
    browser will cycle through until it finds a font that is installed on the
    user&acirc;&euro;&trade;s system. This means that you can use Gill Sans, and if your
    users don&rsquo;t have it, you can give them an adequate substitute that will not
    diminish their experience. As <a href=
    "http://24ways.org/2007/increase-your-font-stacks-with-font-matrix">Mr. Richard
    Rutter has already illustrated</a>, there are quite an array of typefaces that may be
    sitting on your user&acirc;&euro;&trade;s machine ready to serve your design
    needs.</p>

	</div>
    <p>Unfortunately, common web practices and/or technologies are not fully utilizing
    this functionality. There seems to be a lack of consideration for the process of
    creating these stacks. For example, Dreamweaver&acirc;&euro;&trade;s defaults look
    like so:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif</li>

      <li>Courier New, Courier, monospace</li>

      <li>Times New Roman, Times, serif</li>

      <li>Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif</li>

      <li>Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif</li>

      <li>Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As you can see, there are not a whole lot of options, and the substitutes are
    often not appropriate. This is an example of how lax typographic standards on the web
    are leading to poor design decision making. I am not going to speculate, here, as to
    whose fault it is that <a href="http://webtypography.net/sxsw2007/">typography on the
    web leaves much to be desired</a>&hellip; there are probably as many culprits as
    there are offenses. I will say, though, that font stack are ultimately design
    factors, and should be scrutinized as such.</p>

    <h4>All in the Family</h4>

    <p>When creating a stack, first consider the context of the text. Is it going to be a
    headline, sub-head, or body copy? This can determine the appropriate order of a
    stack, considering certain fonts work well for setting blocks of copy, while others
    work better at larger sizes. For example, Helvetica&acirc;&euro;&trade;s nuances work
    well on screen, when the text is large enough, while Helvetica
    Neue&acirc;&euro;&trade;s slightly wider letter forms read better at smaller sizes on
    screen. Arial reads slightly better than Helvetica at smaller sizes on the screen, as
    well. Therefore, your font stack for Helvetica may need to be different depending on
    whether it is used for body copy or a page title.</p>

    <p>Once context is considered, there are few more things to consider when building a
    stack. First, select your ideal candidate (more on that later). From there, the path
    of your choices may fork depending on the context.</p>

    <h4>Titles <em>[ greater than 12px ]</em>:</h4>

    <h5>font-family: Ideal, Alternative, Common, Generic;</h5>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Ideal</strong> &ndash; Your selection need not be bound by what is
      considered universally &ldquo;web safe&rdquo;. There are many more fonts that have
      a fairly high market penetration that you can choose from. Just don&rsquo;t pick
      anything too obscure, or you will be the only one seeing it.</li>

      <li><strong>Alternative</strong> &ndash; When selecting headline and title fonts,
      remember that the nuances will be more noticeable, and therefore you need to select
      an alternative that is closer in spirit than size or relative value. To find a
      spiritual cousin, you may want to look within the same <a href=
      "http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/classifications.html">type classification</a>,
      or look for something created by the same <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_designer">type designer</a>. Mainly, look for
      similarities in the letter forms.</li>

      <li><strong>Common</strong> &ndash; At this point, you just need something similar
      that is not going to break your layout.</li>

      <li><strong>Generic</strong> &ndash; Cap it off with the generic classification,
      for those zealots that don&rsquo;t believe in installing fonts.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Paragraphs <em>[ less than or equal to 12px ]</em>:</h4>

    <h5>font-family: Ideal, Fit, Common, Generic;</h5>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Ideal</strong> &ndash; Even if you intend this copy to match the
      titles, you may want to consider the readability of the typeface over the span of a
      few paragraphs. For example: Helvetica Neue and Arial are better suited to be read
      small and on screen than Helvetica.</li>

      <li><strong>Fit</strong> &ndash; Find something that is well represented,
      cross-platform that will not wreck your layout. For example: There is about 2 pts
      difference between the width of Times New Roman and Georgia. Multiply that by the
      number of characters in your copy blocks, and you could spell disaster for your
      otherwise-nicely-considered design.</li>

      <li><strong>Common</strong> &ndash; Something similar in flavor and
      well-represented.</li>

      <li><strong>Generic</strong> &ndash; Again, finish with the generic
      classification.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Keep in mind that if your ideal font is only well represented on Macs, for
    example, you may want use an alternative that is more prevalent on Windows machines.

    systems, take a look at <a href=

    <h4>Stack Your Deck</h4>

    <p>Now, using these guidelines, and building on the experience of <a href=
    "http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881791326">much
    more knowledgeable type gurus</a>, I have compiled a list of font stacks that will
    both open up more font possibilities for web designers, and hopefully offer more
    appropriate substitutes:</p>

    <p><em>p &ndash; balanced for paragraphs or body copy</em><br />
    <em>t &ndash; balanced for headlines or titles</em></p>

      <li>Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif <em>- p</em><br />
      Verdana, Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif <em>- t</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>I did deliberately leave out some fonts, *cough* <a href=
    "http://bancomicsans.com/home.html">Comic Sans</a> *cough*, because I do not
    particularly see the use in them, and I don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t believe that these
    examples will solve every typographic purpose, but hopefully it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    a start. Feel free to apply the above rules and create some stacks of your own.</p>

    <p>If you&acirc;&euro;&trade;re interested in a more comprehensive comparison,
    <a href="http://unitinteractive.com/blog/blog-images/BetterFontStacks.pdf">download
    the pdf <em>[13.1 mb]</em></a>. In it, you will find examples of both titles and
    copy, set in the different font stacks.</p>

    <p>Now, font stacks help us open up a few more typographic options to create a more
    engaging online communication, but how do we choose which specific face to use? And
    which of these web safe fonts will work as a good compliment? More on that in my next
    post.</p>
